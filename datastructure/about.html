  <h1>Visualisation for Data Structures</h1>

  <ul class="main_point">
    <li>
        Sorted Array data structure 
        <ul class="sub_point">
            <li>This data structure refers to an array of numbers that are sorted in an ascending order.</li>
            <li>This allows for easier queries when considering the weights of each elements.</li>
            <li>This data structure works best in situations of finding elements quickly, it takes O(log n) time for binary search. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        linked list data structure
        <ul class="sub_point">
            <li>This data structure refers to an array of numbers that contains a pointer that points to the next node (or element). </li>
            <li>The head node will be created first, and each node contains information of the value it contains, and the pointer to the next node. </li>
            <li>The simulation shows a one-way linked list which only has 1 pointer in 1 direction. </li>
            <li>A major benefit of this data structure is its memory efficiency, since only the value and pointer information is stored.</li>
            <li>Moreover, it is easy to insert new values to the front or back of the list. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Hash table data structure 
        <ul class="sub_point">
            <li>This data structure is a combination of sorted array and linked list data structure. </li>
            <li>The hash table has a hash function that is used to compute an index, known as a hash code. </li>
            <li>The hash codes will then be placed into an array of buckets through MOD (which finds the remainder of the divisor) as individual linked list data structures. </li>
            <li>The array of buckets are stored as sorted array data structures. </li>
            <li>Hash tables taps on the benefits of sorted array and linked list to store data in an abstract manner. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Binary search (for sorted arrays ONLY)
        <ul class="sub_point">
            <li>This algorithm is for arrays sorted in ascending order. </li>
            <li>It will compare the value in the middle of the array to the target value. </li>
            <li>Should the middle value be higher than the target value, the element can only be found at the left hand side (smaller value), and vice versa. </li>
            <li>Such algorithm makes searching much more efficient as the time complexity is O(log n). </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Linear search (for linked list)
        <ul class="sub_point">
            <li>List is unordered and information stored within each node is value and pointer.</li>
            <li>Search for any element requires the iteration of entering into the node and comparing the values to the target value.</li>
            <li>This algorithm searches through every element of the linked list. </li>
            <li>The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n). </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Delete
        <ul class="sub_point">
            <li>This function removes a target element from the array. </li>
            <li>The simulation shows how the array leaves an empty spot, before removing the spot.</li>
            <li>This depicts how space occupied by the array changes when an element is deleted.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Insert
        <ul class="sub_point">
            <li>This function inserts an element into the array. </li>
            <li>The simulation shos how the array inserts an empty spot, before inserting the element into said spot. </li>
            <li>This depicts how space occupied by the array changes when an element is inserted. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
